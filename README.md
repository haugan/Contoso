# Contoso
Following the official documentation from Microsoft's ASP.NET web pages, and
referencing and working through various books on C# and ASP.NET - 
I'm building this web application to further develop my understanding
of ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, LINQ, ASP Identity, and other important libraries (like Bootstrap and jQuery!).

## Thank God for Bootstrap!
